note:

    Greetings!  My name is Matt Williams and I'd like to share about
    public speaking.  Fact is, between Agile and other paradigms,
    being able to communicate effectively is more important than
    ever. In this talk we'll explore ways that you can become a
    confident and effective speaker.
