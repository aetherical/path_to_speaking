note:
    Greetings!  My name is Matt Williams and I'd like to share about
    public speaking.  Fact is, between Agile and other paradigms, being
    able to communicate effectively is more important than ever. In this
    talk we'll explore ways that you can become a confident and effective
    speaker.
