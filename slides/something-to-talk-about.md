note:
    The start of any good speech -- just like any conversation, is 
    having something to talk about. People are a lot more comfortable,
    generally, engaging in a conversation. Public speaking is the same --
    you need to engage your audience. Most of the talking is on your side,
    but isn't that the case when you're telling about your kids or the
    movie you saw the other evening?
